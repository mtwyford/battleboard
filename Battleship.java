This is a war themed game, where the computer will have to try and guess the location of your ship, and attempt to sink it. You will start off by recieving 3 ships. Each ship has holes where the computer can hit. The lengths of the three ships will be 2, 3 and 4 units long. On this board (lower board), you will place the three ships. Each ship must be placed horizontally or vertically across grid spaces—not diagonally—and the ships can't go off the grid. In addition to that, your ships can't overlap. \n Players will take turns firing shots to atttempt to hit your opponents ships. The computer's hits and misses will be tracked on this lower board.");
